#
# doydl's Microsoft Identity Authentication Library — azauthlib
#
# The `azauthlib` module is a secure authentication library for acquiring, caching, and
# refreshing Microsoft identity platform tokens across public and confidential client
# applications — built on MSAL for Python and MSAL Extensions.
#
# Designed for predictable credential handling, `azauthlib` supports interactive, silent,
# device-code, and client-credentials flows — separating delegated scopes from application
# scopes and returning explicit authentication results and typed failures.
#
# The library combines exact-path configuration loading, OS-backed secret storage, and
# encrypted, cross-process-safe token persistence to support Microsoft Graph clients,
# automation services, and desktop applications.
#
# It avoids import-time filesystem side effects, fails closed when secure cache persistence
# is unavailable, and normalizes application data paths consistently across Windows, macOS,
# and Linux.
#
# Whether embedded in command-line tools, desktop applications, background services, or data
# pipelines, `azauthlib` provides a focused security boundary around Microsoft identity
# configuration and token acquisition.
